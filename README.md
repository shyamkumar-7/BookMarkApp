Challenges faced and walkthough of my steps while building the app:

1. Already worked with next (app router) before but this was my first time working on supabase authentication and realtime features.
2. Took some time to get familiar with the supabse dashboard and its features. 
3. Connected OAuth ( google cloud console) , took client ID and secret key from their and integrated it inside supabase Authentication panel inside "google" option.

4. Developed the project then hosted on my github repo here with .env.local file in .gitignore .
5. After that i deployed it on vercel with the .env.local content inside the environment section inside vercel deployment.
6. Then used the url generated after deployemeny inside URL Configuration( site url) in supabase.
